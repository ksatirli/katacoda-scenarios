# Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized applications. You have finally managed to set up your
Kubernetes cluster and applications, but how do you consistently monitor your applications and
ensure things are running as expected? Tools like Datadog make it easy to view your metrics,
but how might you set up standards and observability in a consistent way?

This workshop will demonstrate how easy it is to implement observability best practices and
principles across your entire Kubernetes cluster.

From provisioning to production, weâ€™ll discuss how to leverage several providers to ensure
that new applications get created consistently, monitored reliably, and implemented
declaratively.
