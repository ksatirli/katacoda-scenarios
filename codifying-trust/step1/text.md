# Verify local installations

Let's test our local workspace to ensure we have all the right tools for today's workshop. If the following commands aren't immediately available, just give it a minute to download and install the necessary binaries—don't worry, it won't take long!

First, let's confirm that we have a valid Terraform executable in our workspace. Terraform should be version `0.15.0` or higher.

`terraform version`{{execute}}

❓ Does this version look correct?

If so, change into the Workspace directory:

`cd /workspace`{{execute}}

Then, click _CONTINUE_ to go to the next step.
